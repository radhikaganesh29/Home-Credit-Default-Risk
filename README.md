This project aims to predict whether a client will repay a loan using alternative data sources.

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Explored the dataset to understand the structure and the features.
- Conducted data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- Performed initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns.

### Feature Engineering and Model Building

- Implemented advanced feature engineering techniques to create new features.
- Built initial machine learning models, including logistic regression and decision trees, to predict loan repayment.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Model Optimization and Tuning

- Optimized machine learning models using techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and grid search.
- Applied cross-validation to ensure model robustness and generalization.
- Improved model performance by fine-tuning algorithms and selecting the best models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

### Neural Network Implementation and Final Model

- Developed a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network for loan repayment prediction.
- Compared the performance of the neural network with traditional machine learning models.
- Finalized the best performing model and validated its performance on a test set.
